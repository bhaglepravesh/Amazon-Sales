Amazon Sales Exploratory Data Analysis

## Analysis of Amazon Sales

sales are less or high in comparison of the last weeks or the last month we will visualise the data pictorially because we humans are very less interactive or feel bored to read the numbers and words. for the industry perspective the main motive is to generate the more and more revenue by providing the products to make the people life
better and easer. That's why I choose this datasets

## Information About Dataset

I have considered the Amazon Dataset which contains the many attributes of almost 51290s costumers and this dataset is hosted on Kaggle. The dataset contains 51290 rows and 24 columns variables. Before jumping into building the model, let’s have a look into the variables & their definitions.

## Useful Insights 

How the sales of Amazon will increase on the basis of day by day, month by month and year by year What are the patterns which the customer follow How the sales get hight on the week days and the festivals.
